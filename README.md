House Price Prediction Project
Project Overview
This repository contains code and data for a house price prediction project. The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict residential property prices using structured attributes such as area type, location, size, number of bathrooms, and total square footage.

Files
main.ipynb
Jupyter notebook containing complete analysis, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, and implementation of machine learning models (such as Linear Regression and Decision Tree). Includes visualizations, model evaluation metrics, and code for model deployment.

main.csv
Dataset containing property listings with features:

Area Type

Availability

Location

Size

Society

Total Square Feet

Bath

Balcony

Price

How to Use
Clone the repository

bash
git clone: https://github.com/siddiquinadeem51/ADS_Mini_Project.git
Open main.ipynb
Use Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code to open and run the analysis step by step.

Data Exploration

Load main.csv using pandas.

Explore statistical summaries and distributions.

Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Handle missing values.

Feature transformation (such as one-hot encoding).

Create new features (e.g., price per square foot).

Modeling

Train regression models to predict house prices.

Use cross-validation and grid-search for model selection.

Evaluation

Check model performance using error metrics and visualizations.

Deployment

Save the trained model for use in web or business applications.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

To install requirements:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Outputs
Cleaned datasets.

Trained regression models.

Predictions and error metrics.

Visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, etc.)
